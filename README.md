# üè• Hospital San Vicente ‚Äì Medical Appointment Management System  
### Developed in C# with Entity Framework Core and LINQ

---

## üìò Overview

**Hospital San Vicente** previously managed its medical appointments using physical notebooks and spreadsheets, leading to frequent issues such as duplicate bookings, data loss, and disorganization.  
This project digitalizes the hospital‚Äôs operations by implementing a **centralized system** to manage **patients, doctors, and appointments** efficiently and reliably.

The system was developed as part of a **Performance Assessment Project in C#**, applying **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles, **Entity Framework Core**, and **LINQ** for data persistence and integrity.

## üéØ Objectives

The goal of this project is to create a robust, scalable, and maintainable system that:

- Centralizes patient, doctor, and appointment data.
- Prevents scheduling conflicts between patients and doctors.
- Automates the appointment process.
- Ensures data consistency and validation.
- Supports error handling and user-friendly feedback.

## üß© Features & Functionalities

### 1. Patient Management
- Register new patients with personal details: **Name, Document ID, Age, Phone, Email**.  
- Edit existing patient information.  
- Validate unique document numbers (no duplicate patients).  
- Display a full list of registered patients.

### 2. Doctor Management
- Register doctors with: **Name, Document ID, Specialty, Phone, Email**.  
- Edit doctor information.  
- Validate unique document IDs (no duplicate doctors).  
- List all doctors with **filter by specialty** functionality.

### 3. Appointment Management
- Schedule medical appointments linking a **Patient**, **Doctor**, **Date**, and **Time**.  
- Validate that:
  - A doctor cannot have more than one appointment at the same time.  
  - A patient cannot have more than one appointment at the same time.  
- Cancel appointments (status changes to **‚ÄúCancelled‚Äù**).  
- Mark appointments as **‚ÄúAttended‚Äù**.  
- List appointments by **patient** and by **doctor**.  
- (Partially implemented) Send appointment confirmation emails to patients.  
- (Pending due to time constraints) Record of email notifications with status (‚Äúsent‚Äù, ‚Äúnot sent‚Äù).

### 4. Data Persistence
- Implemented using:
  - **Entity Framework Core**  
  - **LINQ** for querying and filtering  
  - **Lists and Dictionaries** for in-memory management  
  - **MySQL / PostgreSQL** for persistence

### 5. Error Handling & Validations
- Input validation for all entities (patients, doctors, appointments).  
- Exception management using `try-catch` blocks.  
- Clear and user-friendly error messages.  
- Enforcement of all business rules (unique documents, non-conflicting appointments, etc.).
